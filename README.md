# frontend-mentor-first-project
My very first frontend mentors project
there are 3 different project folders in this folder namely: Order-summary-card; fylo-data-storage; Fylo-landing-page respectively.

Order-summary-card:
This project is a plain HTML and CSS design. The design shows the page when a song is ordered, the summary page that shows up displaying the plan, payment subscription and cancel order when no longer interested.
Through this site demo (html-css-only) you can listen to lots of songs, audiobooks and podcasts on any device as it is built to have mobile and desktop responsiveness any device. Also, the interactive states when hovered on changes.
This is just a simple design to put my practical knowledge of HTML and CSS to test as one who’s just starting out in the field of software development.

Like the one above, this page gives the static page of a fylo data storage site in both web and and mobile responsiveness.
